    Query parameters, also known as search or query strings, 
    are a part of a URL that provides additional information 
    for the purposes of identifying specific content or operations. 
    They often come after the main URL and start with a question mark (?). 
    They consist of a series of key-value pairs separated by an ampersand (&).
